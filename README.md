<h2> Facial Detection Algorithm </h2>
<h3> Our Solution: </h3>
<p> We are using openCV and Haar cascades to detect particular features of a face. We have set several thresholds that check for the above mentioned features. As the image clears the threshold, the fitment score of the image keeps updating. If the images passes all the thresholds, it would have a positive score. If the image, at any step, gets rejected, it would have a negative score, unless it passes the sanity check, in which case, itâ€™s Fitment score would be zero. </p>
